            <p>Presentation at the First Generative Neurosymbolic Workshop</p>
            <p>I am thrilled to share that I just finished my talk at the First Generative Neurosymbolic Workshop, held as part of the Extended Semantic Web Conference in Crete. My presentation, titled “How We Can Use LLMs to Create an Ontology for Parkinson’s Disease,” was successfully completed. In this talk, I explored the innovative ways in which large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to develop a comprehensive ontology for Parkinson’s Disease. This ontology aims to enhance our understanding and organization of knowledge related to the disease, ultimately contributing to more effective research and treatment strategies. Collaborating with Pavlos Bitilis and George Vouros, our team at the Intelligent Systems Research Lab (i-Lab) is excited to share these insights and advancements in the field. The potential of LLMs to transform the way we approach complex medical conditions is immense, and we are eager to continue pushing the boundaries of this research. Stay tuned for more updates as we further develop these methods and explore new applications! Konstantinos I. Kotis Pavlos Bitilis George Vouros Intelligent Systems Research Lab (i-Lab)</p>
