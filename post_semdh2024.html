            <p>Exploring LLM-based Semantic Analysis of Historical Legal Documents</p>
            <p>Our team is thrilled to share that we presented a second paper this month titled "Towards LLM-based Semantic Analysis of Historical Legal Documents" at the First International Workshop of Semantic Digital Humanities (#SemDH2024). In this paper, Tania Litaina, Andreas Soularidis, Georgios Bouchouras, Konstantinos Kotis, and Evangelia Kavakli explore the potential of large language models (LLMs) for the semantic analysis of historical legal documents. Our research is still in its early stages, and we are continuously learning and refining our novel methods. However, our findings suggest that LLMs could become a valuable tool for understanding and organizing complex legal data from history. We are particularly excited about the potential applications of this research in the field of legal history. The ability to analyze and interpret historical legal documents with greater accuracy and efficiency could significantly advance our understanding of legal developments over time. We invite you to take a look at our paper and share your thoughts: <a href="https://lnkd.in/gi8NV6uQ">Read the paper</a>. If you're interested in LLM applications or have insights to share, we would love to connect and discuss further! #LLMs #DigitalHumanities #ResearchInProgress Konstantinos I.
