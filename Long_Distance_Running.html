        <h2>Long Distance Paths – Human Endurance as Inner Innovation</h2>
        <p class="date">May 31, 2025</p>
        <p>On Thursday, May 29, 2025, a thoughtful and well-attended roundtable took place at Metropolitan College Thessaloniki, under the title “Long Distance Paths: Human Endurance as Inner Innovation</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Guest Speakers</h2>
         <ul>
          <li>► Georgia Abatzidou, marathon champion, shared powerful personal stories from her athletic career, highlighting how long-distance running shaped her inner strength and perspective on life.</li>
          <li>► Katerina Nikou, psychologist, spoke about the emotional aspects of endurance and how the rhythm and solitude of running can support self-reflection and psychological growth.</li>
          <li>► Dimitris Kasimis, triathlon coach, focused on the life lessons that emerge through endurance training—discipline, humility, and the value of staying committed to a process.</li>
          <li>► The discussion was masterfully moderated by Yiannis Simantiras, radio producer and seasoned marathon runner, whose experiential approach added authenticity and emotional depth to the event.</li>

        <h2>What we talked about?</h2>
          <p>The event offered a reflective take on long-distance running—not simply as a physical achievement, but as a process of inner transformation, emotional resilience, and personal meaning. Marathons, ultramarathons, and challenging trail races were discussed as paths of self-observation, where time, pain, and solitude become part of a deeper personal journey. The discussion was moderated with sensitivity and insight by Yiannis Simantiras, a radio producer and marathon runner, who brought both personal experience and a warm, inclusive tone to the conversation.</p>
          <p>The speakers explored whether endurance could be seen as a quiet form of innovation—not in terms of technology, but in how one chooses to face difficulty, uncertainty, and effort. They described running not as a race for results, but as a way to pause, listen, and reconnect—a kind of research into the self, done step by step. The themes of the discussion often paralleled the experience of doing research itself: the long road, the inner doubts, the need for patience, and the quiet breakthroughs that come when you keep going, even when it’s hard.</p>
          <p><strong><em>At the end of the event, a short certificate ceremony took place for students who completed the developingU continuing education seminar on High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT). It was a chance to recognize their participation and interest in advancing their knowledge through applied training and shared learning.</em></strong></p>
