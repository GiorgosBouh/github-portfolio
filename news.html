                    <p>Exploring LLM-based Semantic Analysis of Historical Legal Documents. Our team is thrilled to share that we presented a second paper this month titled "Towards LLM-based Semantic Analysis of Historical Legal Documents" at the First International Workshop of Semantic Digital Humanities (#SemDH2024). In this paper, Tania Litaina, Andreas Soularidis, Georgios Bouchouras, Konstantinos Kotis, and Evangelia Kavakli explore the potential of large language models (LLMs) for the semantic analysis of historical legal documents. Our research is still in its early stages, and we are continuously learning and refining our novel methods. However, our findings suggest that LLMs could become a valuable tool for understanding and organizing complex legal data from history. We are particularly excited about the potential applications of this research in the field of legal history. The ability to analyze and interpret historical legal documents with greater accuracy and efficiency could significantly advance our understanding of legal developments over time. We invite you to take a look at our paper and share your thoughts: <a href="https://lnkd.in/gi8NV6uQ">Read the paper</a>. If you're interested in LLM applications or have insights to share, we would love to connect and discuss further! #LLMs #DigitalHumanities #ResearchInProgress Konstantinos I.

                    <p>Presentation at the First Generative Neurosymbolic Workshop. I am thrilled to share that I just finished my talk at the First Generative Neurosymbolic Workshop, held as part of the Extended Semantic Web Conference in Crete. My presentation, titled “How We Can Use LLMs to Create an Ontology for Parkinson’s Disease,” was successfully completed. In this talk, I explored the innovative ways in which large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to develop a comprehensive ontology for Parkinson’s Disease. This ontology aims to enhance our understanding and organization of knowledge related to the disease, ultimately contributing to more effective research and treatment strategies. Collaborating with Pavlos Bitilis and George Vouros, our team at the Intelligent Systems Research Lab (i-Lab) is excited to share these insights and advancements in the field. The potential of LLMs to transform the way we approach complex medical conditions is immense, and we are eager to continue pushing the boundaries of this research. Stay tuned for more updates as we further develop these methods and explore new applications! Konstantinos I. Kotis Pavlos Bitilis George Vouros Intelligent Systems Research Lab (i-Lab)</p>

                    <p>Today I had the pleasure of being a speaker at the workshop 'Applications of Artificial Intelligence in Education,' organized by the Association of Tutors of Northern Greece. It was an opportunity to present the interesting topics we are studying at the Intelligent Systems Lab of the University of the Aegean. We discussed how artificial intelligence can transform teaching practices and enhance individual learning. We explored useful tools and programs. Impressive participation with over 100 attendees. Let's join forces to explore and implement innovative solutions that will enhance learning. Congratulations to the association for this initiative.</p>
