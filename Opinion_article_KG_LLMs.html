            <h2>The Importance of Knowledge Graphs in Everyday Decision-Making for Health and Education Professionals</h2>

            <h1>Why Knowledge Graphs Matter in AI for Health and Education</h1>

            <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is changing how professionals in healthcare and education access and use information. While <strong>Large Language Models (LLMs)</strong> like ChatGPT can generate text, they often <strong>lack transparency, reasoning, and scientific accuracy</strong>. In contrast, <strong>Knowledge Graphs (KGs)</strong> provide a structured and explainable way to organize and use information, making them particularly valuable for <strong>trustworthy decision-making</strong> in high-stakes fields.</p>
            
            <p>Recent research highlights that knowledge graphs serve as a <strong>foundation for verifying AI-generated information</strong>, ensuring accuracy, governance, and trust. This is particularly crucial in healthcare and education, where decisions impact lives and require <strong>verifiable sources of truth</strong>.</p>
            
            <p>A knowledge graph organizes information into a <strong>network of entities</strong> (concepts, people, events, objects) and their relationships. Unlike traditional databases that store isolated information, knowledge graphs <strong>connect data in a meaningful way</strong>, allowing professionals to trace relationships, ask complex questions, and derive insights.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Links diseases, symptoms, medications, and patient histories to improve clinical decision-making.</li>
                <li><strong>Education:</strong> Maps learning objectives, cognitive skills, and student progress to support personalized teaching.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>One of the biggest challenges for professionals is ensuring that the information they use is <strong>scientifically valid and up-to-date</strong>. Knowledge graphs help address this by integrating data from:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Clinical guidelines, peer-reviewed research, and electronic health records.</li>
                <li>Educational curricula, learning theories, and assessment standards.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Unlike LLMs, which generate responses based on probability rather than verified knowledge, knowledge graphs provide a <strong>formal structure for evaluating the validity of AI-generated insights</strong>.</p>
            
            <p>Professionals in health and education need to <strong>understand the reasoning</strong> behind recommendations. Knowledge graphs provide <strong>clear explanations</strong> by showing <strong>how information is connected</strong>. For example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Doctors:</strong> Can see why a specific treatment is recommended.</li>
                <li><strong>Teachers:</strong> Can track how a student’s learning difficulties relate to past performance.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Knowledge graphs also integrate multiple sources of information, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Electronic Health Records (EHRs)</li>
                <li>Medical research databases</li>
                <li>Educational curricula and assessment data</li>
                <li>Behavioral and social factors impacting learning</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Frank van Harmelen, in his presentation <em>“The K in ‘neuro-symbolic’ stands for ‘knowledge’”</em>, argues that many AI models lack true semantic understanding. He warns against the illusion of intelligence in AI models that <strong>appear to understand concepts</strong> but <strong>lack actual reasoning ability</strong>.</p>
            
            <p>Knowledge graphs preserve meaning and logical connections, ensuring that AI-powered tools provide <strong>valid, explainable, and structured knowledge</strong>. Emerging neuro-symbolic AI approaches combine knowledge graphs with neural networks, aiming to create AI systems that <strong>think and reason more like humans</strong>.</p>
            
            <p>While LLMs are powerful for generating text, they <strong>lack the structure, reasoning, and reliability</strong> needed for decision-making in healthcare and education.</p>
            
            <p>By using knowledge graphs, professionals can ensure their decisions are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>✔ <strong>Scientifically valid</strong></li>
                <li>✔ <strong>Explainable and transparent</strong></li>
                <li>✔ <strong>Integrated across different sources</strong></li>
                <li>✔ <strong>Aligned with ethical and regulatory standards</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>This is just my perspective on the role of knowledge graphs  in decision-making. There are many different opinions on this topic, and ongoing research continues to shape our understanding of how these technologies can best be used. If you explore discussions across the web, you’ll find diverse viewpoints on whether symbolic reasoning, neural networks, or a combination of both is the most effective approach. My goal here is to highlight why I believe knowledge graphs play a crucial role in ensuring AI remains explainable and reliable, but I encourage readers to explore other perspectives and form their own conclusions.</p>
                            
                As AI continues to evolve, combining knowledge graphs with LLMs may offer the best of both worlds—leveraging structured knowledge while maintaining natural language interaction. However, for professional applications where accuracy, reliability, and reasoning matter, knowledge graphs remain the most trusted solution.</p>
