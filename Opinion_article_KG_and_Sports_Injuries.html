            <h2>Sports Injury Prediction Is Broken — Here’s How Semantic AI Can Fix It</h2>
            <p><em>Posted on April 13, 2025</em></p>

            <!-- Image container for vertical alignment -->
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="KG_Sports_Injuries.png" alt="KG_Sports_Injuries" class="enlargeable">
                
            </div>

            <p>Years ago, during a long jump training session — a sport I loved and trained hard for — I felt something go wrong in my knee as I pushed off. It turned out to be a meniscus tear. My ACL wasn’t torn, but it was likely affected. That moment changed everything. I couldn’t return to training the way I used to, and over time, that experience led me in a new direction — eventually to a PhD focusing on knee mechanics and ACL reconstruction.</p>

            <p>Since then, I’ve worked at the intersection of biomechanics, artificial intelligence, and data science. And every now and then, I still wonder: <blockquote><em>"Could that injury have been predicted — or even prevented — if we had the right systems in place?"</em></blockquote></p>

            <p>Today, I believe the answer is yes. But it requires us to start thinking differently about how we use the data we already have.</p>

            <h3>We Have the Data — But Not the Full Picture</h3>

            <p>We can now collect almost any kind of movement or performance data: vertical ground reaction forces (vGRF), muscle activation (EMG), joint angles, injury history, training load — you name it. The problem? Most of it lives in separate systems that don’t communicate with each other.</p>

            <p>What’s even more surprising is how often teams and coaches collect all this data, but don’t really keep or revisit it. They run tests, gather numbers, maybe share a report — and then move on. A season later, there’s nothing to compare against. No baseline. No history. And that’s odd, considering how easy it’s become to track athletes consistently using wearables, cloud systems, and portable tech.</p>

            <p>The issue isn’t about collecting more data. It’s about making sense of it — connecting the dots, seeing patterns, and understanding how all the pieces interact over time.</p>

            <h3>Connecting the Dots with Semantic AI</h3>

            <p>This is where <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">knowledge graphs</a></strong> and <strong>semantic AI</strong> come in.</p>

            <p>A knowledge graph lets us organize data by showing how things are related — not just storing numbers, but connecting them. For example:</p>

                <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px;">

                    <li>The athlete had a meniscus tear.</li>
                    <li>Their vGRF data shows asymmetrical loading.</li>
                    <li>EMG shows delayed activation in one muscle.</li>
                    <li>Training load has been elevated for several weeks.</li>
                </ul>

            <p>When those pieces are connected, a system can reason through them and say something like:</p>

            <blockquote>
            <p><em>“This athlete is showing signs of increased risk. It’s worth taking a closer look.”</em></p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>This isn't just about prediction for the sake of numbers — it’s about prevention that makes sense.</p>

            <h3>Why It Matters</h3>

            <p>Having lived through injury and spent years researching how and why these things happen, I see a real opportunity here. This approach isn’t just useful for elite athletes — it can help coaches, therapists, and anyone who wants to train smart and stay injury-free, for a longer period.</p>

            <p>Imagine being able to catch a problem before it becomes serious — not because someone noticed something during warm-up, but because a connected system flagged it based on real data and context.</p>

            <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>

            <p>We’ve got the sensors. We’ve got the data. And we definitely have the computing power. What we’ve been missing is the structure — a way to tie it all together and use it in a meaningful way.</p>

            <p><strong>Semantic AI</strong> can help us do just that. Not just to treat injuries after they happen — but to catch them early, and maybe stop them from happening at all (or at least, try better, fail better <span>😉</span>).</p>
