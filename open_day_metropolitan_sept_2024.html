            <h2>Open Day Seminar Metropolitan College, Campus Thessaloniki</h2>

            <p>Today, I had the opportunity to deliver a seminar to the first-year students at Metropolitan College Thessaloniki, centered on Ankle Sprain Prediction using OpenSim. We explored how this powerful musculoskeletal simulation tool is revolutionizing our understanding and prevention of ankle injuries.</p>
            <p>The seminar delved into:

                Drop Jump-Induced Sprains: We discussed how high-impact activities, such as drop jumps, contribute to ankle sprains, and how we can simulate these scenarios in OpenSim to predict injury risks.
                Ankle Foot Orthosis (AFO): We reviewed the role of AFOs in stabilizing the ankle and reducing the likelihood of sprains, particularly during challenging movements.
                Evertors and Invertors: These key muscle groups were analyzed for their protective roles against ankle sprains, demonstrating how they function to prevent excessive movement that could lead to injury.
                It was inspiring to see how engaged the students were with the concepts of biomechanical simulation and injury prevention technology. OpenSimâ€™s ability to provide real-time insights into human movement is an exciting advancement for those of us working to minimize sports and movement-related injuries.
                
                I look forward to more in-depth discussions with the students as we continue to explore these important topics in the future!</p>
